# Chat with Invoice Formatted Data Extraction

This project enables users to interactively chat with invoice documents and extract structured, formatted data from them. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and document parsing techniques, it provides an intuitive interface for querying and retrieving invoice details efficiently.

## Features

- **Chat-Based Interface:** Communicate with the system using natural language to ask questions about invoice documents.
- **Automatic Invoice Parsing:** Upload invoice files (PDF, image, etc.) and automatically extract key data fields such as invoice number, date, total amount, vendor details, line items, and more.
- **Structured Data Output:** Receive results in a structured and formatted manner (e.g., JSON, tables) suitable for further processing or integration.
- **Multi-Format Support:** Supports various invoice formats and layouts, including scanned images and digital PDFs.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Handles follow-up questions and context, enabling conversational extraction (e.g., "Whatâ€™s the due date on the last invoice?").
- **Export Options:** Export extracted data for use in spreadsheets, databases, or accounting software.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Can be integrated as a web application, chatbot, or API service.
